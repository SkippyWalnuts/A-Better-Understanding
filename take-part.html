                        “When I initially saw Becca's reverse mentoring scheme invite, I was immediately intrigued as someone had finally created a programme with an opportunity to speak to more senior team 
                        members about topics faced in digital marketing! 
                        
                        I loved my mentorship and when facing new career challenging situations, I was able to openly discuss my circumstances and given fantastic advice from an experienced professional. 
                        For that I am grateful! 
                        
                        However, my defining moment (aha moment) was my training sessions with Becca. Not only was Becca accommodating to my schedule 
                        to provide me a 121 sessions but this also enabled a magical teaching moment! Our session on navigating difficult conversations and how to apologise was 
                        truly eye opening. Thanks to Becca I carry that lesson with me and apply it on a daily basis. If this is not a sentiment to 
                        encourage you to take part in this fantastic initiative, I don't know what is!”​

                    “I think the premise of the reverse mentoring programme is a very unique way of uncovering and discussing unconscious biases. Awareness is key when it comes to unconscious bias.​ Often, people aren’t simply aware of issues and behaviours unless highlighted, 
                    so this was a good platform for mutual openness and discussion, and bringing certain issues to the surface.”​
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Peter Huijboom, dentsu Mentee 2022:</strong> “…it’s important that leaders and managers 
                      realize that they will need to lead and manage very differently to be successful in this new world. 
                      Openness, Transparency, Vulnerability, and Generosity are all critical to mastering these new relationships. 
                      For many, this is an important ‘reset’ in how they work, and leaders may benefit from some ‘reverse mentoring’, 
                      helping them understand what really drives their partners in the workforce."
